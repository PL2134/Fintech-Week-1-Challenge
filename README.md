# Yu Liu's Case Study: Betterment

## Overview and Origin
  
The name of the company is Betterment. Betterment was founded in August 2008 in New York City by Jon Stein, a Columbia Business School MBA graduate, and Eli Broverman, a lawyer out of NYU School of Law. 

The founder started Betterment when it occurred to him that the concepts he had learned while studying behavioral economics and biology in college could actually apply to the many mistakes he was making in managing his own investments. Throughout his trading journey, he had made a lot of mistakes in investment. While economics is good at explaining the world at a macro level, it fails to explain human behavior. He then wanted a service that did all of this for him: told him what to do with his money, and then did it. He realized that the only way he was going to get something like that was to build it himself.  

Betterment has raised a total of $435M in funding over 10 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Sep 29, 2021 from a Debt Financing round. The first several rounds were through venture capital, and they also gained some funding through secondary market and debt financing. Betterment is funded by 26 investors. Kinnevik and Aflac Global Ventures are the most recent investors.

## Business Activities
 
Betterment is here to simplified people's way of investment. As people are usually confused about their investments. Betterment uses automation to deliver personalized financial advice at scale with a focus on supporting customers and increasing access to financial solutions. When it comes to investing, people expect not to know what they’re doing. They expect to be confused, simply because the traditional players have made it confusing. So Betterment can help people through cash management, guided investing, and retirement planning.

Betterment offers a very user-friendly platform for new investors or for those that do not wish to spend a lot of their free time monitoring their portfolio. 15% of U.S. Stock Market Investors got their start in 2020, Schwab Study shows. This portion of new investors is a siginicant share of all investors.

Even if the investors do enjoy managing their own portfolio, further diversifying through an index strategy with Betterment could help alleviate any “user error” from bad investment choices. 

Betterment ramps it up a few notches with extra tools to help the investors to plan and manage their taxes and charitable giving. Plus, it includes a variety of choices as it builds the investors' investment portfolio, including funds for socially responsible companies and innovative technologies, among others. With a highly usable app packed with features and the ability to customize portfolios, Betterment should be on the investors' shortlist for a new robo-advisor.  

Betterment also provide two service plans, including optional access to human advisors. It has portfolio mix for multiple financial goals. The investors are able to purchase fractional shares. Betterment also provide a retirement-planning tool and a goal-planning tool. Betterment provide their service at a low cost. In addition, many robo advisors require a minimum investment of $5,000. Betterment has no minimum. Betterment allows the investors to adopt a more aggressive or more conservative approach as desired.

Betterment achieves distributed data processing with Airflow. They also created an open-source project called Blazer to work as an extension of the Backbone router. They write test for Flutter application with test randomization. Betterment is using Julia to solve our own version of the “two-language problem"–the idea that the language in which it is most convenient to write a program is not necessarily the language in which it makes the most sense to run that program. Plenty activities done through Betterment involved the actual movement of money—deposits, withdrawals, transfers, rollovers, etc. They were executed via a database-backed job-execution framework called Delayed, a newly-open-sourced library. Betterment uses SLOs to pursue user happiness. They also use Python as their building block.  

## Landscape
 
Betterment is in the domain of robo-advising of the financial industry.
 
In the last 5-10 years, the growing technological advancements such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are also emerging as one of the major factors driving the market's growth. Moreover, the growing adoption of AI and ML in investment platforms is one of the major robo advisor trends. In addition, governments are encouraging smaller vendors to enter the market with innovative products in various economies. From observations, the demand for low-cost investment advisory is anticipated to open up opportunities for market growth. Furthermore, the growing usage of advanced analytics and big data can potentially broaden the scope of robo advisors significantly.

Other major companies in this domain are Fincite GmbH, Wealthfront Corporation., The Vanguard Group, Inc., Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Ellevest, Ginmon Vermögensverwaltung GmbH, Wealthify Limited, Social Finance, Inc., SigFig Wealth Management.

## Results

In terms of the business impact that Betterment brought to the market, it opened people's eyes on how investment can be simplified for the general public. Also, they provide Socially Responsible Investing portfolios, which contains Broad Impact portfolio, Climate Impact portfolio and Social Impact portfolio. Through doing the legwork for the investors, the investors are able to invest in the areas that is align with their values, and create impact in those fields accordingly.

The success for the business in the field of robo-advising is measured through its historical return and performance. Since the bottom of the stock market in February of 2009, the average Betterment portfolio returned 214.7% – and that is after the exchange-traded fund and Betterment fees. Also, the Asset Under Management (AUM) for Betterment is 33.8 billion USD.Another metrics to measure success is the number of individual clients. Currently Betterment has nearly 700,000 clients.  

Other metrics on ranking how good is Betterment in the field of robo-advisory. Morningstar's assessments prioritized low, transparent fees; a robust risk-tolerance questionnaire; logical mapping to portfolios; sound portfolio diversification that steers clear of questionable asset classes and investment tactics; and a solid range of planning-related features. Betterment ranked second, respectively, thanks to its low costs, nuanced asset-allocation approaches, broad range of financial planning tools, and transparency.

Comparing to its competitors, Betterment‘s average annual return over the past 5 years is 0.9% higher than their biggest competitor, Wealthfront. When compared to the average private client investor, Betterment outperformed them by 78.7% in that same period. 

## Recommendations

After researching throughoutly about Betterment, it has a high ranking across different platform. However, if I were to advice the company, I would suggest them to offer the service of direct-indexing, and this is particularly attractive for tax sensitive investors. While Betterment does offer tax-loss harvesting, but the lack of the choice of direct indexing is where Betterment falls short of competitor Wealthfront, where direct indexing is available for free on accounts of $100,000 or more.

I strongly believe that by offering direct indexing, it allows the investors in Betterment to own the securities in the benchmark in a seperately managed account, meaning the investors have direct ownership of the underlying securities. The benefits of direct indexing include tax-loss harvesting, charitable-giving flexibility, holding period management, gain-realization deferral, personalisation and value alignment. All of the benefits of direct indexing to the investors will make Betterment a more favourable choice to the investors.

A lot of technologies are to be utilised in order to achieve direct incexing. For example, Betterment will need to use automated data analytics provide valuable insights. It will also utilise artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities enable real-time risk monitoring. Based on the experiences of some existing companies that are already offering direct indexing, using advanced AWS services can achieve faster time-to-market. Betterment should also use machine learning technology to process unstructured data through Real-Time AI.

These technologies are appropriate for my solution as direct indexing requires speed for execution, and the customers seek comprehensive, cost-effective, and fast experiences with the cloud. The fast and scalable nature of the AWS cloud combined gives the company the power to be flexible, reducing cost and risk. Customers often choose to migrate their existing software from private data centers to AWS. AWS's service can aid in mitigating the pitfalls of a lift-and-shift move and reduce total cost of ownership.
By using machine learning and artificial intelligence, they help unlock the hidden value of unstructured data such as handwritten notes, images and convert them into analytics- and process-ready information. Get actionable insights from this data.
